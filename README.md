# tictactoe
This is a multiplayer tictactoe game using firebase, nuxt, tailwindcss and typescript.
This is an opensource project created by Enrik Paepe

Installation process:
-git clone git@github.com:Enrik2002/tictactoe.git / git clone https://github.com/Enrik2002/tictactoe.git
-cd tictactoe
-npm install
-npm run dev

This will allow you to run the application in development mode. When running npm run dev it might take 20-30 seconds for the web-application to properly run. The errors that occur when running npm run dev are non fatal and won't affect the functionality, it is a typescript configuration issue.
